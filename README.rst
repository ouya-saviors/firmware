OUYA system apk files
=====================

The publicly released ``.apk`` files inside the OUYA firmware are optimized
(``.odex`` files) and cannot be decompiled as easily as standard ``.apk`` files.

This repository containes de-odexed system apks that can be inspected easily
with tools like `jadx-gui`__.
